'''Problem Statement 
A company stores employee details in a tuple. Each employee record contains: 
employees = ( 
    ("E101", "Anuj", 92), 
    ("E102", "Rahul", 76), 
    ("E103", "Priya", 58), 
    ("E104", "Neha", 88), 
    ("E105", "Amit", 45) 
) 
Where: 
• First value = Employee ID  
• Second value = Employee Name  
• Third value = Performance Score  
Tasks 
Write a Python program to: 
1. Display details of employees scoring 80 or above.  
2. Count the number of employees who need improvement (score below 60).  
3. Find the employee with the highest score.  
4. Create a list containing the names of all employees scoring above 75.  
5. Display the performance category for each employee:  
o 90 and above → Excellent  
o 75 to 89 → Good  
o 60 to 74 → Average  
o Below 60 → Needs Improvement  '''
