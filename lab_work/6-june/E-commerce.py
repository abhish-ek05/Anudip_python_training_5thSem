'''Problem Statement 
An online store records orders as: 
orders = [ 
    ("Laptop", 55000), 
    ("Mouse", 800), 
    ("Keyboard", 1500), 
    ("Monitor", 12000), 
    ("Pen Drive", 600) 
] 

Write a program to: 
• Display all products costing more than ₹1000.  
• Find the most expensive product.  
• Calculate the total order value.  
• Count products costing below ₹1000.'''

    ("Mouse", 800), 
    ("Keyboard", 1500), 
    ("Monitor", 12000), 
    ("Pen Drive", 600) 
]
